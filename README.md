rubymotion_cookbook
===================

RubyMotion iOS Cookbook is our project to learn RubyMotion, iOS development, and to provide a valuable community
resource of code examples. We're experts in none of these things so if you have a suggestion, be gentle, it's
our first time.

We'll be following along with the actual *iOS5 Programming Cookbook* by Vandad Navandipoor from O'Reilly, 
starting with chapter two, and porting over the Obj-C code examples as we progress through the book. If you have
the book and want to add or correct the project, send us a pull request, we'll gladly accept the help!

Additionally, we're aware that [BubbleWrap](https://github.com/mattetti/BubbleWrap) exists and we're intentionally 
avoiding it. Wrapping difficult Cocoa libraries with elegant Ruby is a great idea, but we're attempting to map our
examples 1:1 to the cookbook so that the body of the text remains relevant and using an external resource defeats
that purpose.
