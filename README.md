RubyMotion iOS Cookbook is our project to learn RubyMotion, iOS development, and to provide a valuable community
resource of code examples. We're experts in none of these things so if you have a suggestion, be gentle, it's
our first time. This is a work in progress.

We'll be following along with the actual *iOS5 Programming Cookbook* by Vandad Navandipoor from O'Reilly, 
starting with chapter two, and porting over the Obj-C code examples as we progress through the book. If you have
the book and want to add or correct the project, send us a pull request, we'll gladly accept the help!

Additionally, we're aware that [BubbleWrap](https://github.com/mattetti/BubbleWrap) exists and we're intentionally 
avoiding it. Wrapping difficult Cocoa libraries with elegant Ruby is a great idea, but we're attempting to map our
examples 1:1 to the cookbook so that the body of the text remains relevant and using an external resource defeats
that purpose.

## Chapter 2 - Implementing Controllers and Views  ##

### 2.1 - Displaying Alerts with UIView
[Complete](https://github.com/IconoclastLabs/rubymotion_cookbook/tree/master/ch_2/1_displayingalerts)
### 2.2 - Creating and Using Switches with UISwitch
[Complete](https://github.com/IconoclastLabs/rubymotion_cookbook/tree/master/ch_2/2_usingswitches)
### 2.3 - Picking Values with UIPickerView
[Incomplete](https://github.com/IconoclastLabs/rubymotion_cookbook/tree/master/ch_2/3_pickingvalues) 
Being inexperienced with Obj-C, we haven't yet figured out how to implement the UIPicker. 
Any insight would be appreciated.
### 2.4 - Picking Date and Time with UIDatePicker
[Complete](https://github.com/IconoclastLabs/rubymotion_cookbook/tree/master/ch_2/4_PickingDateTime)
### 2.5 - Implementing Range Pickers with UISlider
[In Progress](https://github.com/IconoclastLabs/rubymotion_cookbook/tree/master/ch_2/5_rangepickers)
